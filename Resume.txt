This is a test of the emergency broadcast system.

In the event of a real emergency you will be directed to blah, blah, blah.

Spread kitty litter all over house shake treat bag favor packaging over toy yet instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason. Spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce meow stretch, and refuse to leave cardboard box. Chew foot i like big cats and i can not lie. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms make meme, make cute face chase the pig around the house purr for no reason and refuse to leave cardboard box lounge in doorway lick butt. Hide head under blanket so no one can see intently sniff hand. Destroy couch as revenge chase ball of string and stand in front of the computer screen. Vommit food and eat it again hack up furballs. 

Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country...
